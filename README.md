## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

  1.  In the summary output, each (Pr(>|t|) value represnets the probability that each coefficient contributes a random amount of variance to the linear model. According       to our results, vehicle length are statistically to provide non-random amount of variance.

  2.  The slope of the linear model is not considered zero because their is a linear relationship.

  3. Linear model predict mpg of MechCar prototype effectively because the p- values is not less than zero.
